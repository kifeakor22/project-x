This is simply a great tasting dram and a blinding price point. Red currants and blackberries combined with vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa! You're all set up for a fireside chat! ",

This Highland malt has a lot of citrus (orange) with chocolate and some roasted coffee and vanilla characteristics. A Royal Heritage dates back to 1263 when Chief of the Mackenzie clan saved King Alexander III from a charging stag. Hence the 12 pointed stag emblem was awarded as the clans coat of arms! One for the top shelve of the home bar and fire side stories! Matured in Bourbon & Oloroso sherry casks for that balanced flavour."

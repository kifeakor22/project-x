    "review": "Another personal favourite of the WT co-founders. Serious street cred for this bottle in your collection. This Highland malt has a lot of citrus (orange) with chocolate and some roasted coffee and vanilla characteristics. A Royal Heritage dates back to 1263 when Chief of the Mackenzie clan saved King Alexander III from a charging stag. Hence the 12 pointed stag emblem was awarded as the clans coat of arms! One for the top shelve of the home bar and fire side stories! Matured in Bourbon & Oloroso sherry casks for that balanced flavour."

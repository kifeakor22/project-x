    "review": "Amazon Basket Case or Basket Filler?!'What a surprise. How did that get in my Amazon Prime basket?! Surprisingly oakay for a 17 quid bottle of Scotch. Only aged for 3 years in ex-American bourbon barrels - no surprises here. Cheap enough and in plentiful supply. Alarmingly with a metal cap rather than cork top. It’s a blend from other Scotch whiskie both single malts and grain whiskies - my guess is from Highlands and Speyside with a little Islay thrown in. Lowest legally allowable ABV at 40%. Still if you want a big bottle for mixers, cocktails, fancy cooking sauces - Jeff Bezo's yer guy! If this introduces more of the general public to Scotch Whisky - then I'll embrace it. As good as any other mainstream blended Scotch whisky - if not a little smoother. Nice touch with the deer plastered on the label.",

In 1899, Shinjiro Torii founded House of Suntory with a special vision: to produce Japanese spirits par excellence that appeal to the Japanese palate. We salute the founder's vision and agree that his legacy is producing craft spirit that is on par with the mighty Scotch whisky. Hakushu distillery’s whiskies have won countless awards over the past decade, including World’s Best Whisky & they seek to combine the traditions of Scotch whisky making with the Japanese drive for perfection. The Reserve is produced by combining different styles of whisky – all produced in the same place – including bright, young whiskies with much older stock and a small proportion of heavily peated whisky. The result is a fragrant dram with notes of cucumber, white fruit, soft herbs and a faint hint of smoke. Excellent served neat or long with ice and soda in a classic Whisky Highball.WT absolutely adores Japanese single malt and blended malt whiskies. They are light, floral, delicate and beautifully balanced - a style all of their own. The distillery is one of the most spectacular in the world at the foot of the Japanese Alps. This liquid is part of the blend that goes into their iconic sister company Hibiki.This wonderful expression is suitable for an Intermediate or Expert whisky drinker who loves experimenting, floral/lighter whisky style, trying world whiskies and getting Whisky Promiscuous!!",
